# shARe

Share your Augmented Reality Experiences

Built using Flutter & Unity3d.

Unity AR Foundation was used to build a cross platform AR experience and flutter-unity-widget was used to imbed the unity module into the flutter.
All the UI/UX is built in flutter and flutter-unity communication is handling all the nexessary calls between unity and flutter.

ShARe allows the user to draw in Augmented Reality and share it with you friends. The way the app works is as follows:

Feel free to unleash your creativity by drawing to your heart's content. After completing your masterpiece, simply tap the upload button. Your drawings will be showcased to friends and other users in the Explore tab. Each drawing is geotagged on maps, allowing others to pinpoint its location.

In the Explore tab, you'll find drawings within a 25-meter radius of your current location. Clicking on a specific drawing deploys it as if it were being drawn before your eyes, providing an immersive experience of artistic expression.
