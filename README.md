Built using Flutter & Unity3d.

Unity AR Foundation was used to build a cross platform AR experience and flutter-unity-widget was used to imbed the unity module into the flutter.
All the UI/UX is built in flutter and flutter-unity communication is handling all the nexessary calls between unity and flutter.
